// Implement a class Employee. An employee has a name (a string) and a salary (a double). Provide a constructor
// with two arguments public Employee(String employeeName, double currentSalary) and methods public String getName()
// public double getSalary() public void raiseSalary(double byPercent) These methods return the name and salary,
// and raise the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain percentage. Sample usage:
// Employee harry = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 50000); harry.raiseSalary(10);
// Harry gets a 10 percent raise Supply an EmployeeTester class that tests all methods.

   private String name;
